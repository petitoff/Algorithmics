# Algorithmics
A repository for my algorithm science. It contains various information on algorithmic problems and how to solve them.

</br> The incomplete knowledge he has is stored here. I have external notes on algorithms that are not included here so my knowledge may be more than that contained in this repository.
In addition, I have a separate [codewars](https://github.com/petitoff/codewars) repository where my algorithms that I developed to solve kata tasks are contained.

# Precise description

### Programming language
In the repository the programming language used for learning is:
- JavaScript

### Knowledge is gained through movies
